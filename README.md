# Inclusive design scenarios tool

### Contributing
Made with a boilerplate Gatsby app, check `packages.json` for script helpers.

### Product intention
through the design process, maybe we can make a useful tool for stress-testing designs against commonly overlooked use-cases through a series of scenarios.

#### Basic product:
- could be used as a solo design tool (like https://gfda.co/)
- could be handy in a crit
- over time, designers using the tool will remember some issues and deal with them by default

#### With a contribution model, practitioners could:
- contribute to the dataset
- challenge less worthwhile scenarios
- vote on the scenarios they value
- contribute higher-level sets of scenarios

#### What it won't be:
- an exhaustive list of human needs

### Design Notes

personas are mostly trash
- demographically homogenous 
- vulnerable to bias
- entrench stereotypes
- filled with irrelevant details
- used as a substitute for proper ongoing research

activity-focussed design is better for making tools to help people achieve their desired outcomes, but in MVP-driven product teams accessibility and inclusion can be seen as an irritating after-thought. it works fine for me, can't we just ship it?

product management used to be a function of marketing. it's easy to rationalise that we design products for the most valuable target users. this approach has led to significant harm at scale, e.g. twitter taking over a year to give any mechanism for reporting or blocking abusive content, a problem none of the makers had ever experienced personally.

great design, like the oxo good grips potato peeler, is often a result of designing for edge-cases and trusting the middle will sort itself out. (in that case, putting a normal potato peeler in a mountain bike grip so a partner with arthritis could use it more comfortably)
