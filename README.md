# About

A tool for stress-testing inclusivity of designs against commonly overlooked scenarios. [Read more about it here](https://www.theuxtoolbox.com/inclusive-design-scenarios/about/).

# Contributing

This is the sort of project which will especially benefit from a breadth of lived experience. Want this to be as easy as possible, with everybody welcome to get involved.

### Non-technical contributions

Trying to make creative use of the [Issues Tracker](https://github.com/theuxtoolbox/inclusive-design-scenarios/issues) so people can contribute content improvements, ideas, feedback and bug reports, and get involved in discussion, without writing code or running anything locally. If you have a (free) GitHub account, you can create and post here.

### Technical contributions

Anybody is welcome to [submit a pull request (PR)](https://github.com/theuxtoolbox/inclusive-design-scenarios/pulls). Just ask that any PR references an issue and includes a clear description of what it is.

# Accessibility

It's intended to reach the [WCAG 2.2 AAA standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/). If you spot anything falling short, please report and/or submit a fix.

# Running locally

It's a simple [Gatsby Quick Start](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/quick-start/) app, with proxies for the main [Gatsby CLI tools](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/gatsby-cli) included in `package.json`. There's no database or CMS.

`npm start` cleans, builds and serves with all mod cons.
