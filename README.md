A tool for stress-testing inclusivity of designs against commonly overlooked scenarios. [Read more about it here](https://www.jackbush.github.io/inclusive-design-scenarios/about/).

It's intended to reach the [WCAG 2.2 AAA standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/). If you spot anything falling short, please report and/or submit a fix.

## Contributing

This project needs a breadth of lived experience. Want this to be as easy as possible, with everybody welcome to get involved.

### Non-technical contributions

Trying to make creative use of the [Issues Tracker](https://github.com/jackbush/inclusive-design-scenarios/issues) so people can contribute content improvements, ideas, feedback and bug reports, and get involved in discussion, without writing code or running anything locally. If you have a GitHub account (free), you can create and post here.

### Technical contributions

Anybody is welcome to [submit a pull request (PR)](https://github.com/jackbush/inclusive-design-scenarios/pulls). Just ask that any PR references an issue and includes a clear description of what it is.

## Writing scenarios

Only submit a scenario if it comes from real experience — your own, someone you know, or observations from user research or testing sessions you've run. The value of this collection is that it reflects things designers would otherwise miss; invented scenarios defeat that purpose. Scenarios are written in first person.

- **Human, not clinical.** Use common names for conditions (chemo brain, lazy eye, gamer's thumb). When a clinical term is necessary, explain it immediately after — "It's called chemo brain" — rather than assuming familiarity.
- **Situation first, consequence second.** Each scenario has two parts: what is happening to this person, and how it affects their use of the web or technology. The consequence doesn't have to be stated explicitly — a behavioural detail can carry it — but the cause-and-effect chain should always be present.
- **No generalisations.** Concrete detail is what makes a scenario stick. Not "a person with motor difficulties" but the exact situation: fell running to close car windows in the rain, served on a lightship in the North Atlantic, has a grabby child in one arm. These details aren't decorative — they produce the immediacy that makes the reader feel the friction.
- **No pity or inspiration.** State conditions matter-of-factly. Describe coping strategies with the same neutrality as the conditions themselves. Avoid the tragedy narrative and the inspiration narrative equally.
- **No longer than necessary.** We want these to be memorable, so length should follow complexity. A one-sentence scenario is fine if it says everything. Three sentences are fine if there are multiple distinct implications to convey.
- **What to avoid.** Don't moralize or state the design lesson explicitly — imply it. Don't use euphemisms or describe the person purely by their condition; most scenarios establish profession, history, or personality alongside it. Don't overclaim emotional states unless they're a specific, functional consequence of the condition.

To add a scenario, create a new `.md` file in `src/content/scenarios/` with a descriptive filename (used as the URL slug) and a `title` in the frontmatter. If this seems confusing, log it as an issue (see above) and we'll add it for you.

## Running locally

Built with [Astro](https://astro.build/). No database or CMS — scenarios are Markdown files in `src/content/scenarios/`.
