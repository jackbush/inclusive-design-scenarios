These are friends and family I love. Sometimes I’m describing a group. (One can only describe chemo brain so many times.) Some people are more than one letter. (Yay genetic lottery.) Some represent stages people were in 10 years ago and some stages we know they will hit — we just don’t know when.</p>\n      <p>Robin Christopherson (@usa2day) points out that many of us are only temporarily able-bodied. I’ve seen this to be true. At any given moment, we could be juggling multiple tasks that take an eye or an ear or a finger away. We could be exhausted or sick or stressed. Our need for an accessible web might last a minute, an hour, a day, or the rest of our lives. We never know.</p>\n      <p>We never know who. We never know when.</p>\n      <p>We just know that when it’s our turn to be one of the twenty-six, we will want the web to work. So today, we need to make simple, readable, effective content. Today, we make sure all our auditory content has a transcript, or makes sense without one. Today, we need to make our shopping carts and logins and checkouts friendly to everyone. Today, we need to design with one thought to the color blind, one thought to the photosensitive epileptic, and one thought to those who will magnify our screens. Today we need to write semantic HTML and make pages that can be navigated by voice, touch, mouse, keyboard, and stylus.</p>\n      <p>Tomorrow, it’s a new alphabet.</p>\n\n      <h2>Credits</h2>\n      <ul>\n        <li><em>An Alphabet of Accessibility Issues</em>, Anne Gibson (31 Jul 2014)</li>\n      </ul>\n    </Layout>\n  )\n}\n"],"names":["fontsWrapper","fontFamily","navStyles","position","top","left","width","navItemsStyles","listStyle","margin","padding","textAlign","navItemStyles","display","containerStyles","maxWidth","marginTop","Layout","children","style","to","AboutPage"],"sourceRoot":""}
